    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Naptile M. Peter, and I’m the founder of Naptile Technologies. My passion for technology started early, but the real drive came when I saw how many businesses struggled with outdated systems and inefficient processes. I knew there had to be a better way — and that’s how Naptile Technologies was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since our founding in [Year], I’ve been dedicated to creating tech solutions that are not only powerful but also practical and affordable for small and growing businesses.
